###[Overview](https://bitbucket.org/dynestudio/c4d-export-to-render-farm/wiki/Home#markdown-header-overview)   
When working in certain projects with many objects, groups and effects, it gets a little hard to keep
everything in order. With these scripts you can easily organize all of your objects by using simple colour
coded blocks called Dividers.   

The most important element in this package is called Dividers. The Dividers are a separator object that can
be used to visually separate groups of objects in your projects and thus facilitate the worklow inside a file.
There are two types: **Dividers** and **Divider Groups**.   

The **Set Organizer** is a function that is best used at the beginning of a project, so as to easily manage your scene objects. When executed, the Set Organizer creates Dividers and 3 Dividers Groups to organize your cameras, lights and geometry inside the scene.   

Each Divider is created with its own layer. Please see the Tips section for more in depth use of the layer manager.

###[Tips](https://bitbucket.org/dynestudio/c4d-pro-organizer/wiki/Home#markdown-header-tips)  
To greater improve your workow by using in conjuction the Pro Oganizer Tools, we recommend:   

-Dock the Pro Organizer buttons palette near of the object manager to access it more quickly.   

-Assign shorcuts to “Add Divider” and “Add Divider Group” to speed up your workow.   

-You can create a C4D base file containing the “Set Organizer” and some render settings presets. With this way
you don’t need to recreate the same settings and base scene objects every time. For this you only need to
save a scene le called “new.c4d” in your Cinema 4D installation folder. Thanks to C4DtoA support team for sharing [this tip](https://support.solidangle.com/display/A5AFCUG/Arnold+as+the+Default+Renderer).   

-We strongly recommend you to work using layers, which is why we assign one layer for each type of
Divider in the package. When you copy and paste any object from one project to another, it will always stay
in the same layer, helping you to organize everything optimally.
